# Stock Sentiment Analyzer

## Overview
This project aims to predict stock price movements (up or down) using an LSTM-based model. The model leverages historical market data and textual analysis of financial news articles to forecast trends, achieving an accuracy of 85% on the test dataset.

## Features
- LSTM architecture for time series forecasting
- Text preprocessing techniques including tokenization and lemmatization
- Feature engineering to enhance model input quality
- Implementation of predictive analytics for stock price movements

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language
- **Keras**: Deep learning library for building the LSTM model
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization of results
